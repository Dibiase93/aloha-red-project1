# Aloha Project

This is my first full website designed for school at Red Academy. This is a movile first design, incorporating flexbox design as well as a Flikity caroucel using entry level Javascript programing. Completed an index.html file including all HTML markup language. Completed a CSS file and folder including: fonts,  CSS reset, and a Normalize.css file. Including a simple Javascript file, with a fuction to provide an alert when an Email is entered correctly.


## Instructions

Simply open link provided.

### Challenges

Most difficult part for me was try to control flex box to get the perfect position I wanted. Also had some issues trying to figure out how to center the nav menu vertically.

#### Learning Curve

Alot of my process, while developing this webpage was top to bottom. While growing as a developer simutaniously working on this page, I learned better more efficient ways to do things. Then would spend half a day going back and fixing all my old code. At times, it was very frustrating, but I love the fact that I now have a good understanding of the process and can't wait to apply all the skills I learned on my next project.
